*** Cut and paste the for loop here ***

*** What is the for loop doing? ***
messages is a list of messages that gets passed back to the client. The for
loop iterates over each item in the list and puts it in the HTML. the result is
that the entire list gets printed because each element of the list is now
contained within the HTML.
